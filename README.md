# Mobile-Application-and-Testing


I can ensure that my program code is functional and secure because I tested for every requirement in the SRD, used best testing practices (to ensure each test was working properly), and had 100% code coverage. Each of the steps and more are vital to the functionality and security of a program, and because of the potential harm bugs can cause, they should be taken seriously. When doing testing I did my best to get into a serious mindset, trying to remeber that any mishaps on my part could indirectly hurt someone down the road.
---------------------------------------Interpreting user needs is usually the job of the product owner. The product owner will interpret the user needs and with the help of the software development team, they will create a System Reference Document. The System Reference Document or SRD will spell out in detail what the program will do called requirements. Then the software developers will make an application to satisfy those requirements, and the testers will make tests that test the software for those requirements. If the software developers and testers succeed then a program will be made that alligns with the SRD. If the Product Owners strategy for satisfying user needs with the software was right, then the software will be successful.
